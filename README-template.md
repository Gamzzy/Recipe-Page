## Overview

### Screenshot

(./Recipe-page-design.jpeg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

I learned how to use the Margin and Padding CSS elements to great effect, using it to move the content from one end to another was an eye opening.
The first of many techniques to learn.

### Continued development

I'll be focusing on CSS more as it's quite broad and requires alot of time to learn about the CSS elements and properties.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for designing the HTML element. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
